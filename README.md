This code was developed by Otte Beljaars for the Computer Science for Business Analytics course (FEM21037) at Erasmus University Rotterdam. The results were produced using Python version 3.12.

The "Main.py" script implements a scalable product duplicate detection method. It identifies candidate product pairs using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which are then analyzed using the Model Similarity Measure (MSM) to detect duplicates.

The input file for "Main.py" is "Dataset.json."
